Personal project for an easier overview on budget and savings.

Soon in life I found out that budgeting is very important to be able to save for anything or to have the ability to retire someday.
Sadly this get's more and more difficult these days. Therefore I did what one would do ... I created an excel calculation to gain the necessary overview.
It was simple, not really beautiful, but it did the job.

Now that some things in my life settled I have now the time to get into coding again in another field (I am a mainframe developer). Instead of COBOL I will be trying to use "modern" languages, technologies and tools to finally build something beautiful. And MAYBE someone out there think's it is useful for themselves and get's some help making it through life a little bit easier.

Let's see if it works...
